Analyzing JSP Code

  The PMD plugin analyzes by default Java. You can configure it to analyze Java Server Pages files instead
  as shown below.

  The example assumes that the JSP source code is stored in various subdirectories under the source directory
  <<<src/main/webapp>>> and enables the built-in JSP ruleset(<basic>).

  Note that this example runs two plugins: build-helper-maven-plugin and maven-pmd-plugin. Because the JSP files are
  not in the original source directory (typically <<<src/main/java>>>) the build-helper plugin is used to add the
  additional directory to the list of source directories which PMD will search.

  Here is a section of a sample pom.xml file. This POM sets up a profile called "pmd" which will run the two plugins
  when activated. The result should be a file in <<<target/site>>> called pmd.html, which will contain a report of
  the problems detected by PMD.


 <<<mvn generate-sources site>>>
